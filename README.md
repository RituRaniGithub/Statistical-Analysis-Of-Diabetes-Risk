# Statistical Analysis of Diabetes Risk

## Objective
The objective of this project is to statistically examine the association between demographic, clinical, lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors and diabetes risk using health survey data. Through exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and logistic regression, the study aims to identify key factors that remain strongly associated with diabetes risk after adjusting for multiple variables.

## Questions Explored
In this analysis, the following questions are explored:

1. Do people at diabetes risk tend to have higher body weight (BMI)?
2. Is diabetes risk more common among individuals with high blood pressure?
3. Does diabetes risk differ between males and females?
4. Are people who regularly consume fruits and vegetables less likely to be at diabetes risk?
5. Is difficulty in walking associated with higher diabetes risk?
6. How do general, physical, and mental health relate to diabetes risk?
7. Are individuals who delay medical care due to cost more likely to be at diabetes risk?
8. Among individuals with diabetes risk, does age distribution differ by sex?
9. Is diabetes risk higher among individuals with lower education or income levels?
10. Which factors remain most strongly associated with diabetes risk after multivariable adjustment?

The findings from this analysis are relevant for healthcare providers and public health organizations aiming to identify populations at higher risk of diabetes. 
The insights can help guide targeted prevention programs, risk stratification efforts, and policy decisions focused on improving early diagnosis, healthcare accessibility, and long-term cost reduction.
